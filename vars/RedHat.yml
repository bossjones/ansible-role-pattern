# Define a dict with the needed packages for this service.
# Remember that one of the principles is idempotence, so you should not
# use 'latest' when installing a package.
# The better is always use the same way as 'package1', because it allows 
# updates that they dont affect the configuration (bug, security)
# by just only run the role. Have a look at 'tasks/install.yml' to see
# how it works.
